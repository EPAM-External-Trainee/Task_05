## Task05. Data_structures_Generics
### Task 1
* Develop your own generic "binary tree" type for storing the results of tests performed by students and their results they are presented in an ordered form.
* Provide the ability to store any type of data, supports possible comparisons.
* Student information may contain fields that store the student's name, the name of the test, the date of its completion, and the test score for this student.
* Implement the algorithm of balancing the tree.
* Provide the ability to serialize and deserialize the tree in XML-file.
* Develop unit tests for testing the generated classes.
### Task 2
* Develop your own generic type for serialization of any classes that implement the Serialize marker interface.
* Provide methods that implement serialization/deserialization:
1. to a binary file;
2. to a text file in JSON format;
3. to an XML file.
* Ensure that the class version is checked during deserialization.
* Provide serialization of not only classes, but also their generalized ones collections that implement the ICollection<T> interface.
* Develop unit tests for testing the generated classes
